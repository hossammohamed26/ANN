# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Algorithm using Python

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm for solving classification or regression problems. The algorithm is built using Python and utilizes the Keras library with TensorFlow as the backend.

## Overview

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. ANNs are widely used in machine learning and pattern recognition tasks. This repository provides an implementation of a basic ANN algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks.

## Usage

To use the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hossammohamed26/ANN
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or editor.

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install the necessary packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Prepare your dataset. Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and split into training and testing sets.

5. Modify the `testing()` function to specify the configuration settings for your ANN model, such as the number of input features, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, and other hyperparameters.

6. Run the `ann.py` script.

   ```
   python ann.py
   ```

7. The algorithm will train the ANN model using the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the testing dataset.
